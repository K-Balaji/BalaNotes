## Test Locally
1. Install the latest version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>. This will install the Node Package Manager.
2. Download the above repository as a ZIP File.
3. Extract the ZIP File to a directory of your choice.
4. Open your terminal and navigate to that directory.
5. Now enter the following in the terminal - 
```sh
npm install electron --save-dev
npm start
```

## Technologies used
- <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron" target="_blank">Electron</a>
- Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>

## Future Plans
- This app will be cross platform (after I figure out how to get electron to compile my code for MacOS and Linux)
- Apart from this, bugs shall be fixed (if any) and new features shall be added
- I'll use Tailwind CSS and Tailwind UI instead of Bootstrap
